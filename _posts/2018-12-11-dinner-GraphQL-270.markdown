**Abstract**

What if you could update the structure of the JSON payload you receive from your backend without having to make code changes across controllers, DTOs, services, and SQL queries? This is the promise of GraphQL--an alternative strategy to traditional REST APIs that allows client code to specify exactly what data it needs. This session will offer a nuts-and-bolts exploration of how to quickly implement a GraphQL API within a (Java) Spring app using the Spring Boot GraphQL starter. Real-world considerations such as testing, performance, and security will also be discussed so that attendees will leave well-prepared to start writing their own GraphQL endpoints.

**Bio**

As a lazy 8th grader Steve taught himself to program a calculator to do his algebra homework for him. Later, after spending a decade as a math teacher, Steve returned to the practice of capturing solutions within machines.
