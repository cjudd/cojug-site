**Abstract**

Functional style of programming was introduced in Java 8. Many organizations are still transitioning to Java 8 and more so, embracing the functional style. If you are like the speaker, who spent decades on imperative style, then the transition to functional style can be intimidating. In this presentation we will learn about the fundamentals of programming in functional style, the set of tools that we can reach into to solve problems as a series of state transformation. We will learn the how but also the benefits along the way as well.
