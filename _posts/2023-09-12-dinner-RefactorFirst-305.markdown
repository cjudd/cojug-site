**Abstract**

Static analysis tools do a great job of telling us we write terrible code, but they don't usually provide guidance on what should be fixed now and what should be left alone. RefactorFirst helps developers prioritize design debt and deliver more features as a result of improved design with the least amount of effort. I'll show you how to run RefactorFirst on a Java project, go over the details in the generated graph and table, and take a look at a few God classes that are identified.
 
I'll also give a brief walkthrough of the RefactorFirst codebase (it's pretty small) so you can see for yourself how God classes are identified and ranked. At the end, I'd love to hear your feedback and ideas on how RefactorFirst can be improved.
