**Abstract**

Quantum computers can solve some classes of problems much faster than conventional computers. But the terminology can be confusing. What are qubits, superposition, and entanglement? And how can you harness them to write programs? In this session, you will learn the language and concepts of quantum, and understand what classes of problems are well-suited to quantum computing. We will look at sample algorithms, debug a sample program with a simulator, and finish with a live demo running on an actual quantum computer in the cloud.
