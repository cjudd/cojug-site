**Abstract**

In this presentation, we'll dive into the exciting world of Spring AI, a powerful framework that simplifies the integration of AI models into your Java applications. We'll explore how Spring AI enables developers to implement common use cases, such as "Q&A over your documentation" or "Chat with your documentation," with ease.

Throughout the session, we'll experiment with various AI model providers and types supported by Spring AI, discuss the framework's portability and advantages, and demonstrate how to get started with a simple project. We'll also delve into more advanced topics, such as storing conversation history for better context understanding and using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases to add context to conversations.

By the end of the presentation, you'll have a solid understanding of Spring AI's features, APIs, and how to leverage them to create AI-powered applications more efficiently and effectively. To help you get hands-on experience, we'll provide an open-source example project and a companion blog post, allowing you to explore and play around with Spring AI on your own.

Get ready for another fantastic COJUG meetup, and prepare to embark on an exciting journey into the world of AI-powered Java applications with Spring AI!

**Bio**

Jackie Gleason is a seasoned developer with a diverse background spanning multiple verticals and renowned organizations. According to the resume he so graciously bestowed upon me (because apparently, I don't have anything better to do than read human resumes), this proud Ohio State Buckeye has tackled projects using a wide array of programming languages, including Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Rust. When he's not busy being a rockstar at J.P. Morgan Chase, Jackie is hard at work developing an AI-powered IoT RAG platform and a streetparty planning site â€“ because clearly, his ambition knows no bounds.
