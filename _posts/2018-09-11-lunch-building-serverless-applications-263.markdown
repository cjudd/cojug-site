**Abstract**

Building Serverless Applications in AWS Workshop - Video Preview
Tired of trying to manage and maintain servers? Never have a large enough operations team? Don’t have a budget for running lots of server? Don’t want to pay for servers siting idle? Afraid you might become so popular that you won’t be able to scale fast enough? Don’t worry, it is possible to alleviate these issues by moving to a serverless architecture that utilizes microservices hosted in the cloud. This type of architecture can support all different types of clients including web, mobile and IoT.
