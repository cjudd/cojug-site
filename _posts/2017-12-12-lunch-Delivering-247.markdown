 **Abstract**

 What do Facebook, Google, Netflix, LinkedIn, WordPress and Etsy all have in common? They are all well known IT organizations that practice continuous delivery and deployment (CDD). This helps them reduce the risk associated with releasing code, improve system resiliency, and reduce overall software development costs. At any point and often multiple times per day, they deploy the latest changes to their production environment with full confidence because their builds have been tested automatically. In this session you will learn how to continuously deliver with confidence. You will learn how to set up a development pipeline for a sample application. Step by step, individual tasks will be assembled and linked together to form a pipeline that takes a code change from source control all the way to a live production environment. But a pipeline is just the start. Along the way you will learn how you can use feature toggles, fast failures, small changes, and optimized tests to encourage a culture of CDD right now.â€‹
