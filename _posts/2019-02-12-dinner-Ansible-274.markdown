**Abstract**

An integral part to any DevOps effort involves automation. No longer do we wish to manage tens, hundreds or even thousands of servers by hand, even if that were possible. What we need is a programmatic way to create and configure servers, be those for local development, all the way to production.

This is where tools like Ansible come into play. Ansible offers us a way to define what our server configurations are to look like using plain-text, version-controlled configuration files.

Not only does this help with avoiding “snow-flakes”, but it promotes server configuration to participate in the SDLC, pulling server configuration closer to the developers.

In this session, we will explore what Ansible has to offer, decipher the Ansible terminology, and run some examples to configure a local server.
