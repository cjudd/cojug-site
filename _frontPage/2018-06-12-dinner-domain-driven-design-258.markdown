Domain Driven Design (DDD) was published in 2004. It has remained relatively obscure even as it has been very influential. Even if you haven’t heard of it, you’ve probably heard some of its terms. Recently, it has experienced a resurgence in popularity with the rise of microservices. Come learn what DDD has to say about controlling the complexity of your software by limiting coupling.
