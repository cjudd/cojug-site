**Abstract**

Startups are often focused on de-risking various aspects of their company, whether that's in terms of funding or team or product/market fit. Choosing technology that's right for your organization's goals is another way to effectively help reduce your startup’s risk and give your team a fighting chance at success.

This presentation will discuss Rhove’s technology choices, including using Java for the main product platform, through the lens of startup risk. I’ll show how you can build a decision framework for your own organization to help figure out where it's appropriate to build for stability vs speed, and how you don’t necessarily need to compromise for your most critical applications.
