 **Abstract**

It’s Friday night and you’re making your character for a fun evening of gaming. You’ve rolled your abilities and even got two 18s. But what class should you pick given your rolls? If you pick that class, is your character playable? What kind of character have you created?

Or maybe you’re a game master and you’ve been running a game for some time. Do you need to know how much treasure that dragon horde should have? Or are you wanting to figure out how many encounters your players will make it through in an evening so you can prepare enough material?

These important questions can all be answered using machine learning.

Many developers want to make use of machine learning in their applications but aren’t sure what sorts of problems can be solved with it. This talk will explain the sorts of problems that can be solved, what data is required to solve them, and what the results look like. And, we’ll explore it using fun and geeky examples. We will cover six major types of problems that machine learning can solve: regression, forecasting, impact analysis, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. When we’re done, you’ll have a basic understanding of what machine learning can do and what you might want to use it for. I might even be something other than role-playing!

**Bio**

Guy Royse (@guyroyse) works for Nexosis in Columbus, Ohio as a Developer Evangelist. Combining his decades of experience in building software with a history of sharing what he has learned, Guy goes out into developer communities and teaches others how to use the Nexosis API. Guy has programmed in numerous languages over the years—many of them semicolon delimited—including C++, C#, and Java. More recently he has worked with dynamic and more functional languages like JavaScript and Ruby.

Teaching and community have long been a focus for Guy. He is President of the Columbus JavaScript Usergroup and has been part of the session selection committee for CodeMash for the last five years. When given an opportunity, he teaches programming at a prison in central Ohio. In past lives, Guy has worked as a consultant in a broad range of industries including healthcare, retail, and utilities. He spent several years as a consultant for Pillar Technology and several more years working for a major insurance provider. This has given him a broad view of technology application and business problems.

In his personal life, Guy is a hardboiled-geek interested in role-playing games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky interest in history and linguistics. He lives in central Ohio with his wife and three sons. In his spare time, he is a leader in his neighborhood Cub Scout Pack and goes camping a lot.
