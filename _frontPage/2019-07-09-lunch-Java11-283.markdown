**Abstract**

If you haven’t already, it won’t be long before you migrate from Java 8 to Java 11. Hopefully you have been keeping up with the changes made in Java 9 and 10. This session is intended to shade light on the license changes in Java 11 and the new features in 11 you will want to take advantage of as soon as you can.
