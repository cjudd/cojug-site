**Abstract**

Discover the art and science of Prompt Engineering! This emerging field is all about mastering the use of language learning models (LLMs), such as GPT, to optimize your work, understand their capabilities, and even create new products.

Prompt Engineering isn't just about creating prompts; it's about understanding the nuances of LLMs and engaging with them effectively. It's a vital skill for leveraging these AI models to their full potential - boosting their safety, augmenting them with domain knowledge, and integrating external tools.

Mastering Prompt Engineering becomes crucial as we increasingly rely on these tools to streamline our workflows and build innovative solutions.

We'll be diving into the following:

An easy-to-understand introduction to LLMs
Key Principles and Techniques of Prompt Engineering
Real-world applications and use cases
Exploration of various open-source LLMs and their unique capabilities
Build a complete working application using prompt engineering
